# Traffic light
It's my second app :)
I made it during my SwiftBook training.

### The task was:
Create an app that allows you to change traffic lights. When first launch, all traffic lights must be turned off.

By pressing the “START” button, the red light should turn on and the button title should change to “NEXT”. Subsequent pressing of the “NEXT” button should sequentially turn on the traffic lights.
